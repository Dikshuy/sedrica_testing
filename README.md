# SeDriCa setup
Linux version: ubuntu=16.04

Requirements: python=2.7, tensorflow=1.13.1, numpy=1.15.0, opencv=3.3.1

**ENSURE YOU HAVE SOURCED PROPERLY BEFORE RUNNING ANY COMMAND**

### Initial steps:
Turn the UPS(ensure it is not in bypass mode), and then turn on the CPU.

```bash
cd SeDriCa
source devel/setup.bash 
roscore
```

### Camera setup:
connect cameras and set to pc camera mode
```bash
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
```
check using **rqt_image_view**, the views of all camera published on camera{id}/image_raw

### IMU and GPS setup:
first connect imu and then gps
```bash
cd SeDriCa/src/sensors/src/sparton_main_imu/scripts
python SpartonCompassIMU.py
cd ~
cd SeDriCa/src/sensors/src/gps/nmea_navsat_driver/scripts
python nmea_serial_driver.py
```

if it is showing port open error, then write this command:
>sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB1

ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1, just check which port is not open and ensure that one of these is in ttyUSB0 and the other in ttyUSB1.

### 2d-Lidar setup:

check the voltage of the battery and connect LAN wire. connect to lidar2d-1

```bash
rosrun lms1xx LMS1xx_node
```

### Road detection and Lane detection setup:

ensure the lane and road detection parameters are in the same order as cameras (left is 1, middle is 2 and right is 3)

```bash
cd SeDriCa/src/road_detection
python all_linknet.py -m test_ros
cd ~
cd SeDriCa/src/lane_detection
python all_linknet.py -m test_ros
rosrun image_transform fisheye_correction
rosrun image_transform ipm_lane
rosrun image_transform ipm_road
```

### Path planning setup:
```bash
roslaunch hybrid_astar final.launch 
```

### Can Module setup:

switch on the CAN module using the rotating black switch(key switch)
```bash
cd SeDriCa/src/control/scripts 
python car_status_txt_ros.py
python accu-sgu_txt.py
```

### Controls setup:
```bash
rosrun controller pid 
```

### Final step:

Press the green button to start auto mode. Press the red(emergency) button as soon as you want to stop the car.

### Ouster setup:
connect to ouster
> *sudo wireshark* for checking data and port
```bash
roslaunch ouster_ros os1.launch
```
